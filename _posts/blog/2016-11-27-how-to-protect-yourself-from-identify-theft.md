As more and more of us are conducting most aspects of our lives online, hackers are getting better and better at getting into our personal information. The prospect of identity theft is scary but protecting yourself is possible.

## Guard Your Online Information
Online shopping has become the norm and many people use their credit and debit cards to make purchases online. Although this may be convenient for consumers, it’s also pretty convenient for those not-so-good people who are looking to go on a shopping spree with your hard earned cash. Luckily there are ways to protect yourself. Never save passwords and log-in information on websites and change your passwords regularly. If possible, use a credit card rather than a debit card for online purchases as they are more secure for this kind of use. Always be vigilant against phishing attempts and only enter personal information if you are completely sure that the company is legitimate.

## Keep an Eye on Your Bank and Credit Card Statements
Don’t keep your bank statement checking to only looking at the number of the current balance. Vigilance is key when it comes to identity theft so make sure you keep track of all of your incomings and outgoings. If you notice something on your statement that seems worrying, then contact your bank immediately. If you have online banking, then try to get into a routine of checking your statement at least once a week rather than waiting for the monthly statement to come in.

## Shred Sensitive Documents
Shredding sensitive documents is one of the easiest ways to keep your identity safe. Never throw anything away that has any of your personal information on it, including your home address and phone number. Using a cross shredder is an even better way to protect yourself as this makes the letters much more difficult to put back together.

## Invest in Identity Theft Protection
If you are particularly worried about identity theft then it may be a good idea to invest in identity theft protection. If you already are the owner of home or car insurance then it is likely that you can get this protection as an addition to your current policy. If you are unsure about your options then get in touch with your insurance broker from Rowat Insurance and have a conversation about how they can help. It really is a small price to pay for the peace of mind and protection that identity theft insurance would bring.
