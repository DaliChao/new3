This summer, the government is implemented some changes to Ontario car insurance. The changes will go into effect on the June 1, 2016 and it’s important to know about these changes in advance. Our quick guide is designed to give you the hard facts that you need.

First off, you should know that your standard auto insurance policy, which comes from your chosen insurance company, will automatically have newer, lower benefits. These adjustments may work with your situation or they may not.

Understanding which new limits are in place and then evaluating you and other drivers of your car will be vital. An insurance broker should be able to look over your policy and then talk to you about whether or not more coverage is necessary.

## Important Changes to Be Aware Of
Current: Maximum for medical and rehabilitation for non-catastrophic injuries is $50,000 and the current maximum for attendant care for non-catastrophic injuries is $36,000.

Change: When the new changes go into effect, benefits of this type will be bundled together and the total maximum will be $65,000. If you wish to, you may boost this benefit to 130k.

Current: Medical and rehabilitation for catastrophic injuries currently has a maximum of $1,000,000 and attendant care for the same types of injuries has the same maximum.

Change: The new changes mean that the maximum for both types of injuries is now $1,000,000 total. However, you’ll have the option of boosting coverage to $2,000,000.

As you can see, these changes, which just scratch the surface, definitely impact coverage levels. If you don’t feel comfortable with the new maximums, you’ll greatly benefit from pumping up coverage where permitted.

Additionally, all drivers in Ontario must now carry third-party liability coverage, uninsured automobile coverage, direct compensation for property damage, and statutory accident benefits on their vehicles.

Other aspects of accident benefits coverage, such as caregiver benefits, dependant care benefits, and tort deductibles remain unchanged.
