Practicing safe defensive driving is the most important thing you can do to reduce the likelihood of a getting into a car accident. Protect your safety and the safety of other drivers on the road with these tips for becoming a better driver courtesy of car insurance brokers:

## Safety First!
Before you even turn your car on, your seatbelt should always be safely buckled. Make sure passengers have their seatbelts buckled, and assist children with buckling in if they need it. Small children should be seated in car seats according to their size and weight.

## Check Your Mirrors
Before you head out on the road, make sure your seat is well positioned in relation to the steering wheel and windows. Adjust as necessary until you are comfortable. Check all of your mirrors and adjust them until you have the best visibility possible.

## Distracted Driving
According to a 2010 study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 80% of collisions are caused in some part by distracted driving. When you are driving your car, that should be your sole source of attention. Not finding the right song on the radio, or putting on makeup, or texting.

## Rules of the Road
Traffic signs and speed limits exist for a reason – to protect your safety. They convey valuable information about upcoming surroundings and hazards, so take note whenever you see a traffic sign or posted speed limit change.

## Spacing
According to Transport Canada, tailgating contributes to as many as one in three highway crashes. For this reason, you should always keep a safe distance (about two seconds) between you and the car in front of you. Give more space in rough weather conditions.

## Anticipation
A big part of defensive driving is anticipation. Even if you have the right of way, you must be very observant of the behaviour of everything around you - other drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists.</p>

## Alertness
When you are tired or lack focus, the microsecond delay in your reflexes could be bad news on the road. Do not drive if you are tired, drowsy, or on medication that induces these symptoms. If you are driving and feel out of sorts, pull off to the side of the road rather than risk it.

Good drivers aren’t just safer on the road, they also get the benefit of better car insurance rates. Contact us today to find out how good driving habits can help you save on car insurance.
