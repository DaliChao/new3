If you’re thinking about the summer season ahead and want to ensure that you open your cottage properly with safety in mind just as much as fun, you’ll really benefit from reading this quick guide. Our list of things to think about will help you to get the job done right. Once you’ve opened your cottage, you’ll be ready to move forward and enjoy summer living at your home away from home…

## Property Inspection
Most people start off the process by doing inspections of their properties. They walk around and see what might need attention before the summer season and then make a note of things that they notice. For example, you might see holes made by squirrels or other signs of animal/pest infiltration.

As well, you might notice a damaged window or something like that. Take notes on a pad or on your phone and then arrange for needed repairs before you open the cottage formally.

## Dock Inspection
If you have a dock, as so many cottage owners do, you should make certain that it’s secured as it should be. Sometimes, this means repositioning the dock and replacing flotation devices. Anything that’s gone missing during the winter and spring should be replaced.

## Water Supply
Reconnecting pipes is also important. After all, you’ll need a reliable water supply. In addition, you should prime and turn on the water pump. Always fill up the hot water tank before you switch it to the on position.

## Household Prep
Another tip is to stock up on things for your home and kitchen before you open the cottage. It’s so nice to open a cottage which already has food, drink, propane, toilet paper and other essentials on hand.

## Is Your Cottage Insured?
Lastly, you should ensure that your cottage insurance is in force. Never open your cottage unless it’s insured. Your cottage insurance (or any secondary property) is listed on your primary home insurance policy. Just like your home, the cottage has to be covered against all sorts of eventualities – which are more likely when the home is unoccupied for long portions of the year. The best way to find out if your coverage is appropriate, or to find the right level of coverage, is to speak with an insurance broker today. Doing so is also the key to unlocking the best deal on insurance on seasonal cottage insurance.

Now that you know the basics, you’ll be ready to get things taken care of in an efficient and organized manner. By running through the items on our list, you’ll know that you’re opening your summer cottage properly. Before you know it, you’ll be ready to enjoy a more rustic lifestyle during the warm weather months.
