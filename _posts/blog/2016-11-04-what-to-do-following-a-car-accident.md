When it comes to car accidents, it can be helpful to hope for the best, and plan for the worst.  No person wants to be in a car accident. That being said, they occur everyday and the best thing you can do is to be prepared for one when it happens. Let’s take a look at the following list of things you should know if you are involved in a car accident.

## Check yourself and your passengers
Are you OK? Can you move? Do you feel comfortable leaving the car? Are there any other cars currently in the road and are there any other immediate threats? If not, then see if other people in your car are OK.

## Make sure the other driver is not in immediate danger
Is the other driver OK? Do they require immediate medical help? Even if they are the clearly the cause, you must act at once and contact 911 if the other driver is injured and in need of medical assistance.

## Do not admit fault, accept money on the spot, or agree to leave police/insurance out of it
Do not say you are sorry, even if you are just trying to be polite. Do not admit any amount of fault, and do not accept money from the other driver on the spot.  In addition, do not agree to leave the cops/insurance out. Doing any of these things can open you up and make you liable, even if you are not the cause.

## Take a photo of the crash scene
Take photos of the accident scene and any injuries (if applicable) on your smartphone. If possible, email the photos to yourself in case anything happens to your phone.

## Request relevant information from other driver(s) involved
Request information about the other driver, including their driver’s license number, their insurance information, and their license plate. In addition, make sure you get down their full, legal name.

## Take down the iformation of people who witnessed the accident
Take down the contact information of witnesses as they may be required later to prove what happened.

## Contact your insurance broker as soon as you Ccn
Get in contact with your insurance provider ASAP.  Insurance brokers are excellent for these situations and are on your side to guide you through the process of making a claim.

## Keep all receipts
Make sure you keep documented records and receipts of everything related to the accident, from the repair bill on your car to any medical expenses you may incur.
