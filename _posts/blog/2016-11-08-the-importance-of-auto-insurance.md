There are so many different situations in which property can be damaged due to an error on your part. With auto insurance you will be able to assume financial responsibility for the damages you cause, instead of being personally out of pocket. Without insurance you can be faced with time consuming court battles and still end up having to pay for the damages in the end. When you consider the small amount you pay each month compared to the potential amount of money you would have to pay following an accident the benefits far outweigh the negatives. You also have a legal responsibility to drive with auto insurance so that everyone is protected and will receive fair compensation for the damages that are incurred.

## Careful Drivers
Even the most cautious of drivers can be involved in an accident. In fact, the less auto insurance claims and driving convictions you have can translate into lower premiums you will pay for your auto insurance. Keep in mind you are sharing the road with many bad drivers and your auto insurance will cover the damages caused by their bad judgment.

## Time
A bad accident can leave you without a vehicle for an extended period of time while repairs are being made. Your insurance coverage may provide you with a rental vehicle so your life is not disrupted. You can also suffer injuries that keep you from working. Despite your injuries and inability to work your bills still have to be paid. Your insurance will help ease your financial burdens while you are on the mend.

## Vandals and Thieves
Car insurance doesn’t only take care of accidents. It also covers damages caused by vandals and car fires as well as if your car is stolen. Your car can be side swiped when parked on the street or dented by a careless person getting out of their car at the mall. All of your damages are covered by your auto insurance so you don’t have to worry about anything from chipped windshields to scratches and dents that occur when you are parked.

In order to ensure you have all of the coverages discussed above, you can call an insurance broker and they will be happy to discuss with you.
