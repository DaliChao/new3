Every year, the Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC) compiles a list of the [most frequently stolen vehicles in Canada](http://www.ibc.ca/on/auto/theft/top-ten-stolen-cars) for the preceding year. The 2015 edition of the report was just released. Is your vehicle on the list? We hope not, but read on to find out!

## The Most Stolen Vehicles in Canada
If you own a Ford pickup truck, be on high alert! Ford F350s and F250s dominate the top 10, with the only exception being the 2006 Cadillac Escalade. According to Rick Dubin, the vice-president of Investigative Services for IBC, these vehicles are targeted because they do not include an electronic manufacturer immobilizer as a theft deterrent system. They are easier to steal as a result.

1. 2005 Ford F350 (standard, 4-wheel drive, pickup)
2. 2006 Ford F350 (standard, 4-wheel drive, pickup)
3. 2007 Ford F350 (standard, 4-wheel drive, pickup)
