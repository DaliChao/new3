        <p>Finding insurance for your cottage or seasonal home can be challenging. Since cottages and other seasonal homes are often unoccupied during the winter months, these properties are more prone to theft and vandalism. Additionally, cottages are frequently located far from fire stations, and if there was a fire, the property is more likely to be involved in a total loss. Cottages or seasonal homes are therefore listed on your primary home insurance policy as a “Secondary” or “Seasonal” property.</p>
        <p>For that reason, when shopping for cottage or seasonal home insurance it’s best to start by building a policy for your primary residence. At Rowat Insurance our specialty is insuring your home &amp; cottage as we can cross reference insurance between both provinces.</p>
